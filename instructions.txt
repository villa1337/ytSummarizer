# Instructions for Copilot

- This project includes a YouTube summarizer (`app.py`) and a Telegram listener (`telegram_listener.py`).
- When a YouTube URL is received via Telegram, it should be appended to `queue.json` (use add_to_queue).
- Create a `worker.py` script that:
  - Continuously checks `queue.json` for pending URLs.
  - For each one, processes the video using `get_transcript()` and `query_groq()`.
  - Sends the final summary back to Telegram using the same bot.
  - Saves the summary in `/reports/{video_id}.json`.

- Add a `/reports` route in `app.py` that:
  - Lists all summaries in the `reports/` folder
  - Displays the title, thumbnail (if possible) and content of each

- Each report should be saved with structure:
  {
    "url": "https://youtube.com/...",
    "summary": "...",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-30T22:00:00"
  }

- Give me an option to delete reports to optimize the storage
- All pieces (bot, queue, worker, reports) must be integrated into the final app structure.
